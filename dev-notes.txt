DEV NOTES:

-the list version of the solver works better than np version
-in the np version, the try catch statement drives the oscillon profile back instead
of the front, this is wiered as I have tried the same technique in a test problem,
and the alg is right there. This may also be due to the np implimentation.
-optimum results in osc.py
